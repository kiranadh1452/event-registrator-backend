## Typescript Converted from Javascript

> **Warning**
> If you're seeing this, then probably the typescript conversion is not yet complete.

The JS based backend was coded first. Then I decided to convert it to typescript. So, the documentation is not yet complete. Please check the [Javascript version](../js/README.md) for the complete documentation.

## How to run the backend ?

1. Install all the dependencies.

    ```bash
      npm install
    ```

2. Add a `config.env` file here by looking into `config.env-example` file. Fill out the values and rename it to `config.env`.

3. Run the backend.

    ```bash
      npm run dev
    ```
